# writting

A small, public notebook for essays, experiments, and unfinished thoughts.
Published at <https://yap.bellums.org/writting/> and linked from

## Write a post

1. Add a Markdown file to `posts/`. Images go in `posts/Attachments/` and are
   referenced relative to the note, the way an Obsidian vault stores them:
   `![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020260608211427.png)`.
2. Start it with frontmatter for `title`, `date`, `reading`, and `description`.
   `date` should be a real date (`September 10, 2026`); notes are sorted by it
   and grouped by year.
3. Add the post file to the `posts` array in `app.js`.
4. Markdown, LaTeX between `$...$` or `$$...$$`, fenced code blocks, tables,
   and regular Markdown images are supported. A literal dollar sign in prose
   is written `\$`.

For a local preview, run:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit <http://localhost:8000>.

## How it is served

- GitHub Pages builds the `main` branch of this repo and serves it under
  `yap.bellums.org/writting/` (the `yap.bellums.org` CNAME lives in the
  `b-3llum.github.io` repo; Cloudflare proxies the domain).
- `.nojekyll` must stay. Without it GitHub runs Jekyll, which turns every
  `posts/*.md` with frontmatter into an `.html` page and stops serving the
  raw `.md` files that `app.js` fetches, so the index shows only the
  "notes could not be loaded" notice.
- Fully self-contained: no third-party requests at all. `vendor/` holds
  pinned copies of marked 18.0.12, DOMPurify 3.4.15, and MathJax 3.2.2
  (bundle, CHTML fonts, and a11y helpers). Licenses sit alongside.
- One typeface, SF Mono, via the `--mono`/`--sans`/`--term` variables in
  `styles.css`. It resolves to `ui-monospace, "SF Mono", ...` — SF Mono on
  Apple devices, a monospace fallback elsewhere. There is no web font to
  load, so the old Google Fonts link is gone.
- Cache-busting: `styles.css`, `theme.js`, and `app.js` are referenced with
  a `?v=<stamp>` query in `index.html`. GitHub/Cloudflare cache these first-
  party files for hours, so **bump the stamp on every deploy that changes
  them**, or returning visitors keep the stale copy. `index.html` and the
  `posts/*.md` are short-lived (10 min) and self-heal; `vendor/*` is pinned
  and stays unversioned. (This is why a note once appeared to be "missing":
  visitors held an old `app.js` whose `posts` list predated it.)
- `styles.css` and `theme.js` are ported from bellums.org's `static/base.css`
  and `static/theme.js`; keep them in step when the main site's skin changes.
